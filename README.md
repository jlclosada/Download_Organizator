# Download_Organizator

This simple script performs a function of sorting the downloads folder into various subfolders.

In this first version the script sorts the items in the downloads folder into 4 folders: Pictures, Videos, Documents and Music. 
If the folders are not created in the same location the script will do so.

It is a very simple script that is valid as an example, obviously in the future new functionalities will be implemented with functions with better development.

When you run the script, it will go through all the items in the downloads folder one by one, checking their extension. 
Depending on the extension, the file will be moved to one folder or another. In addition, as for the images, a compression task is performed to save 
space and the original image will be deleted.
